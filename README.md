Pain Points: 
- trying to come up with working code for this was a huge pain. 
- Tried writing code in languges that I'm not too comfortable with.

What I could've done to avoid this?
- Practiced using the languages (JavaScript, JQuery) before jumping into a project like this. 

Where to improve?
- The site looks very basic. Spent as little time as I could on the look of the website. It looks like it's come right from the 80s.
- Need to improve time management between the differert front end languages.
